# Sure-Tomorrow-project
In this proyect i create different models to predict the probability that a new client will receive an insurance benefit, which I'll evaluate with rmse, and to predict the number of insurance benefits a new customer may receive using a linear regression model which I'll evaluate with f1
I'll implement data obfuscation to protect the clients data
